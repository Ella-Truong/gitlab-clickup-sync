# GitLab → ClickUp Workflow Sync

Event-driven workflow automation system that synchronizes GitLab development activity with ClickUp task workflows using webhooks, RabbitMQ, background workers, and asynchronous processing.

Built to reduce manual task updates, minimize context switching, and improve engineering workflow visibility during development.

---

## Overview

Engineering teams often work across multiple platforms:

- GitLab/GitHub
- ClickUp
- code reviews
- implementation branches
- merge requests

A common workflow issue is that developers forget to manually update task status after activities such as:

- opening Merge Requests
- pushing implementation commits
- merging completed work

This project automates workflow state transitions based on real GitLab activity.

### Architecture Style

This project follows an **event-driven multi-service architecture**.

```text
GitLab
   ↓
webhook-server
   ↓
RabbitMQ
   ↓
worker
   ↓
ClickUp
```

The repository contains:

- **webhook-server** — webhook ingestion service
- **worker** — asynchronous event processing service
- **shared** — shared TypeScript contracts and event definitions

This design separates event ingestion from workflow processing, improving:

- scalability
- fault isolation
- maintainability
- testability

- [TEST GUIDANCE](docs/test-guidance.md)
- [System Architecture Notes](notes/system-architecture.md)
- [RabbitMQ Notes](notes/rabbitmq.md)
- [E2E Testing Notes](notes/e2e-testing.md)
